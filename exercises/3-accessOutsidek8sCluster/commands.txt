# So by default the Pod is only accessible by the its internal IP adress within the cluster
# To make the container accessible from the outside the cluster virtual network, we need to expose the Pod as a kuberentes service
# Open and analyse the fake-app-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f fake-app-service.yaml

# then if you check the service was create using 
kubectl get services
# So as you can see there's an external -ip pending
# That's because of the minikube to expose a service outise the cluster you need to do:
minikube service fake-app-service

# Now if you change the endpoint you should see the fake app test string
change the api and its ok

or kubectl expose deployment fake-app --type=LoadBalancer

check logs to see response

To think how to update the version of the application and how to scale, increase number of replicas of the pod in the cluster?
